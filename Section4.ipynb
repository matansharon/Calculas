      "the most useful or interpretable solution. With these methods, there is no\n",
      "single right answer—any solution that exposes some interesting aspects of\n",
      "the data should be considered.\n",
      "Validating the Clusters Obtained\n",
      "Any time clustering is performed on a data set we will ﬁnd clusters. But we\n",
      "really want to know whether the clusters that have been found represent\n",
      "true subgroupsin the data, orwhether they aresimply a resultof clustering\n",
      "the noise . For instance, if we were to obtain an independent set of observa-\n",
      "tions, then would those observations also display the same set of clusters?\n",
      "This is a hard question to answer. There exist a number of techniques for\n",
      "assigning a p-value to a cluster in order to assess whether there is more\n",
      "evidence for the cluster than one would expect due to chance. However,\n",
      "there has been no consensus on a single best approach. More details can\n",
      "be found in Hastie et al. (2009).\n",
      "Other Considerations in Clustering\n",
      "BothK-means and hierarchical clustering will assign each observation to\n",

      "for accommodating the presence of such outliers. These amount to a soft\n",
      "version of K-means clustering, and are described in Hastie et al. (2009).\n",
